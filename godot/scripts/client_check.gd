# The headless client check: does the extension load, does the bridge marshal, and did it
# catch a panic doing it.
#
# This is T12's acceptance seen from inside the engine. Everything it asserts is already
# asserted by `cargo test`; what only this run can tell us is whether the cdylib LOADS —
# whether `PharmakosBridge` is a real class in this Godot rather than a placeholder. On a
# fresh checkout it is a placeholder unless `godot --headless --path godot --import` has
# run first, because a non-editor Godot run loads GDExtensions only from
# `res://.godot/extension_list.cfg`, which the editor writes when it scans the project and
# which is git-ignored. G1 lost four runs to that. `cargo xtask stage-client` runs the
# import before this scene, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s client leg runs the pair.
#
# GDScript here is a VIEW and a REPORT and nothing else (AGENTS.md section 3 rule 4): it
# reads what the bridge returns and prints it. There is no rule, no arithmetic on $, kW or
# a duration, and no decision in this file — the one comparison it makes is
# `caught_panics == 0`, which is the assertion itself.
#
# Exit codes: 0 when everything held, 1 when it did not. The CI leg reads that and nothing
# else, because a Godot run that prints a failure and exits 0 is the silent-catch problem
# wearing a different hat.

## table is checked against the same code by `crates/client-gdext`'s own tests.
